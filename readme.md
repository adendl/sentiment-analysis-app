In this app, I tested out using OpenAI's GP3 Chat to generate code for a basic application. The application has two parts:

1. Frontend: A React frontend with a component that allows me to enter text and a controller to send that text to the backend
2. Backend: A Python Flask application which takes a textString and uses the NLTK library to analyse the sentiment, and return the sentiment classification to the frontend to render on the screen.

The dockerFiles have also been generated by GP3, and I have written a run.sh script in the root of the directory which will build and run both the frontend and backend as containers locally on my machine.
